# lina-speech (alpha)

Exploring "linear attention" for text-to-speech.

It predicts audio codec "Ã  la" [MusicGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05284) : delayed residual vector quantizers so that we do not need multiple models.
Featuring [RWKV](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM), [Mamba](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba), [Gated Linear Attention](https://github.com/sustcsonglin/flash-linear-attention).

Consider this as highly experimental and subject to many changes in the near future.

## Samples
